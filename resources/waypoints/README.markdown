# jQuery Waypoints

Waypoints is a jQuery plugin that makes it easy to execute a function whenever you scroll to an element.

```js
$('.thing').waypoint(function() {
  alert('You have scrolled to a thing.');
});
```
If you're new to Waypoints, check out the [Get Started](http://imakewebthings.github.com/jquery-waypoints/#get-started) section.

[Read the full documentation](http://imakewebthings.github.com/jquery-waypoints/#docs) for more details on usage and customization.

## Shortcuts

In addition to the normal Waypoints script, extensions exist to make common UI patterns just a little easier to implement:

- [Infinite Scrolling](http://imakewebthings.github.com/jquery-waypoints/shortcuts/infinite-scroll)
- [Sticky Elements](http://imakewebthings.github.com/jquery-waypoints/shortcuts/sticky-elements)

## Examples

Waypoints can also be used as a base for your own custom UI patterns. Here are a few examples:

- [Scroll Analytics](http://imakewebthings.github.com/jquery-waypoints/examples/scroll-analytics)
- [Dial Controls](http://imakewebthings.github.com/jquery-waypoints/examples/dial-controls)

## AMD Module Loader Support

If you're using an AMD loader like [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), Waypoints registers itself as a named module, `'waypoints'`. Shortcut scripts are anonymous modules.
