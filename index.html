		<h1>Hacks/Hackers Cape Town Journalism Salary Survey</h1>
		<p>Salaries in journalism are more dependent on experience than on race or sex, but most agree - the industry is in crisis.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="span12 lead">This survey was done as a project of HacksHackers Cape Town, an organisation that works to imbed a culture of data journalism in South Africa’s news rooms, by encouraging collaborations on data projects between journalists (“Hacks”) and techies (“Hackers”).
One of the intentions of the survey was to show how data can be collected and visualised, to illustrate what is possible.</div>
	</div>
	
	<a name="methodology"></a>
	<h1>Methodology</h1>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="span12">
			<p class="well">The survey and its analysis was undertaken by Adi Eyal, Jason Norwood-Young, Carolina Ödman and Raymond Joseph, all HacksHackers Cape Town committee members.</p>
			<p>We recruited people for this survey by posting a link to it on various South African journalism forums on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HacksHackersCapeTown">Facebook</a>. We also used <a href="https://twitter.com/rayjoe">Twitter</a> to publicise it and to drive people to the survey. It was also publicised through the closed members-only Geeklist and Google groups forums of <a href="http://projourn.yolasite.com/">ProJourn (Professional Journalists Association)</a>, a nationwide umbrella body representing South African journalists, and <a href="http://www.safrea.co.za/">Safrea (Southern African Freelancers Association)</a>, which represents freelance media practitioners. Details of the survey, with a link, were also publicised on <a href="http://www.bizcommunity.com/">BizCommunity</a> and <a href="http://themediaonline.co.za/">TheMediaOnline</a>.</p>
			<p>The collection of the data was confidential, and it was stated upfront as such, and any information that might have led to the identification of responders was stripped out to ensure confidentiality.</p>
			<p>After some debate, we included some questions on the race of responders as we were keen to identify any disparities that might exist between different racial groups, even though we realised some might take offence. In the event only seven out of 196 who responded did not answer the question about their race. Of those who responded, 68 percent were white and almost 21 percent were black, with a very small number of Coloured and Indian responders. </p>
			<p>For the purpose of analysis, responses were broken into three basic job titles:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Editor</strong> - someone who tells someone else to make content; 
				<li><strong>Journalist</strong> - someone who makes content;</li> 
				<li><strong>Sub-editor</strong> - Someone who fixes someone else's content.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>Considering the make-up of many South Africa news rooms, we believe there should be a higher representation of non-white (African, Coloured and Indian) journalists. In some cases the samples were too small to be representative, particularly of Coloured and Indian journalists, who made up a very small part of the responders. </p>
			<p>But, imperfect as it may be in parts, we see this survey as a beginning of an ongoing process that will help establish a benchmark and grow in time. We hope the information is of much interest to you as it was to us.</p>

	<h1>Highlights</h1>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="span12">
			<ul>
				<li>There was no major salary bias, neither between races nor gender;</li>
				<li>The biggest determinant of salary is experience: each additional year of experience earns you R1,000 per month;</li>
				<li>The average male salary of those who filled in the survey was R26,906, while the average female salary was R23,821, but there were several woman who earned way above the average;</li>
				</li>If you're white and you earn an above average wage - you tend to think that South African journalism is in crisis. If you're white and you earn less than the average wage - you don't think so. Africans don't have the same distribution - they mostly think that there is a crisis regardless of wage.</li>
				<li>Africans are mostly journalists. Whites are mostly editors. But this probably has more to do with the number of years of experience than anything else. (Editors tend to have more years of experience and black tend to have fewer years of experience.)</li>
				<li>If you're in online, you're often in print too. If you're in print, you are sometimes also working online.</li>

			<p class="text-info text-center">There's no real difference between online and print in years 1-10. (The broadcast sample is too small to say.) Journalists with 10-20 experience are earning more in online than in print and above 20 years experience, print journalists are learning less than the average of the survey. This suggests that print journalists need to skill up and learn online skills to complement their print skills, if they hope to earn more.</p>
